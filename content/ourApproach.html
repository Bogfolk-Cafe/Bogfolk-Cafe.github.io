    <p>The Bogfolk Café is an international team of cool people making tabletop RPG
       stuff and trying to make a cool space.

    	   We want to make art, make rent, and help others do the same.</a>
    <p>We are an adhoc co-op, inspired by
       <a href="https://sandypuggames.medium.com/sandy-pugs-co-op-manifesto-f741e7f77af4"
    	   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    	   Sandy Pug's Co-Op Manifesto.</a>
    <p>What does this mean? <a href="https://www.ica.coop/en/cooperatives/what-is-a-cooperative"
    	   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    	The International Co-Operative Alliance</a> defines a co-op as 
       <blockquote>an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet
    	   their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a
    	   jointly-owned and democratically controlled enterprise.</blockquote>
    <p>So, all members of The Bogfolk Café are worker-owners that each receive an
       equal vote in the democratic process of our set-up. We work on the basis of
       democratic delegation, 
       <a href="https://www.jofreeman.com/joreen/tyranny.htm"
    	   target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
		   responsible exercise of power
       </a>
	   , distribution of authority, fair rotation of tasks, rational allocation of
	   tasks, diffusion of information, and equal access to resources.
    <p>Our mutual desire is fair pay for all, and one of our main goals is to be
       transparent and generous where many publishers may not be. 
	<ul>
		<li>25% art</li>
		<li>25% text</li>
		<li>10% layout</li>
		<li>10% project lead</li>
		<li>10% project management</li>
		<li>10% editing</li>
		<li>5% fulfillment</li>
		<li>5% co-op bank</li>
		<li>5% to be allocated based on the needs of the individual project.</li>
	</ul>
    <p>We intend to work thoughtfully and sustainably as well as with kindness and
       empathy. This means we have a very strong preference for local and/or indie
       groups. This also means we will not tolerate bigotry of any kind. (We're
       pretty queer in here.) We prioritize a human-focused approach, we emphasize
       that creative work is still work, and we strive to support small creators and
       platforms. We also recognize when nontraditional methods contribute to the
       overall artistic goal.
